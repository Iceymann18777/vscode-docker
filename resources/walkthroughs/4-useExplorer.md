## Use the Docker Explorer
The Docker Explorer makes it easy to manage, troubleshoot, and deploy containerized applications. The Docker Explorer shows a number of Docker resources such as containers, images, volumes, networks, and container registries. Also, if the [Azure Account extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) is installed, you'll be able to browse your Azure Container Registries.

The right-click menu provides access to commonly used commands for each resource type.
