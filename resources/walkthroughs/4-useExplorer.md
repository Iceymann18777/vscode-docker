## Use the Docker Explorer
The Docker extension makes it easy to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications. With the Docker Explorer, you can examine and manage Docker assets such as containers, images, volumes, networks, and container registries. Also, if the [Azure Account extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) is installed, you'll be able to browse your Azure Container Registries.

The right-click menu provides access to commonly used commands for each type of asset.
