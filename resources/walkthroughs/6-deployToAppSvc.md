## Deploy to App Service
The Docker extension helps you deploy your containerized applications directly to Azure App Service to take advantage of a fully-managed platform in the cloud. To deploy an image to Azure App Service, the image must be uploaded to either Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub.

From the Registries pane, right click on an ACR or Docker Hub image and select **Deploy Image to Azure App Service**. Select **Open Site** in the bottom-right notification. Your container is running in Azure!
